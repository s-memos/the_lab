# 🧪 The Lab – Top Secret 🦊

> **Highly Experimental Security Research and Prototyping**

Welcome to **The Lab**, an experimental space where ideas, code, and research converge.  
Here, we design, build, and refine tools to empower privacy, security, and user freedom on macOS and iOS.

---

## 🚀 What This Is

**The Lab** is:

- A **research incubator** for advanced security tooling.
- A **living archive** of experimental modules and threat intelligence.
- A **sandbox** for testing bold ideas, breaking things, and learning.

Nothing here is final. Everything here is in motion.
